# 340_Test
This project utilizes Webstorm IDE and emulates a client-server model, this will serve as the base model for the next activites in this class. 
The IDE, will run a localhost server, which we will then use to start a HTML webpage. The client (HTML) will be retrieving data from the server (JS files), which stores the data in RDMBS format.

Steps to follow:

1. Install Webstorm IDE.
2. Clone this repository on your machine.
3. Insall Node.js software - https://nodejs.org/en/download
4. Open the cloned repository in Webstorm.
5. Highly likely that there are going to be several errors in the project as the respective libraries need to be downloaded from npm.
6. Open the package.json file in Wesbtorm IDE.
7. Click on "Insall dependencies" balloon that pops up in the right bottom corner.
8. If everything is complete, open the file named app.js - Click on Run and that should display the HTML page.
9. Upon clicking the button in the HTML page, the results of the query should be displayed.
10. The abse version assumes that there is a Database called ADVENTURER and a table called ARTIFACTS in your SQL.
